# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Build the scan's flat tree during the walk: about half the peak memory, and the tree reaches the UI 3–4x sooner after the last directory is read.
- Treemap renders about 2x faster (each pixel shaded once) and hover redraws only what changed, with identical pixels.
- Selecting a file inside a very large folder in the list is about 2x faster.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-09-27

This release improves scan memory use, rendering, post-scan responsiveness, and cleanup plan processing.

- Reduce scanner allocations and store sibling nodes as compact ranges. The measured applications scan used about 16% less peak memory with identical file, directory, and byte totals.
- Draw treemaps and complex Retina rings faster, and make pointer lookup much cheaper for large trees.
- Shorten post-scan UI stalls by isolating progress/status updates, reading volume metadata in the background, and reusing unchanged collapsed outline rows.
- Process streamed cleanup plans incrementally and skip small subtrees during cleanup and prompt preparation.
- Run manual Trash batches off the main thread, prevent duplicate batches and late agent launches after cancellation, and retain cleanup errors until dismissed.

Release builds, rendering comparisons, Rust tests, offline agent/cleanup tests, and native UI checks passed. Reproducible measurements and limitations are in [PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md](PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md). Scan-throughput measurements were inconclusive. Complex Retina ring strokes have small bounded antialiasing differences; geometry and hit behavior are unchanged.

Requires Apple Silicon and macOS 14 or later. This release is signed with the existing Apple Development identity but is **not notarized**. First-time installations may require **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, followed by granting Full Disk Access and relaunching.
